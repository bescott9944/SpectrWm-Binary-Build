# SpectrWm-Binary-Build
This SpectrWm Manual Binary Build / Manual Install so Future Updates of the binary can be easily implementand the use of symlinks, without the use
of yours Disro's Repo's.
This project was the result of a video that The Linux Dabbler produced on 6/29/2020, the video.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYC7qxnjka4}
explained how to build the binaries and what dependencies might be needed fof the build SpectrWm.
The whole point of the video was to show how to install SpectWm without using the outdated Repo versions and use the binaries from SpectrWm's Githib page
(https://github.com/conformal/spectrwm) and how to install it on a headless OS install where the systems boots in to SpectrWm.
This was a great video and got me to think, can it be done on Linux Mint 20 in a VM...
