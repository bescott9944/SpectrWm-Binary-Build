July 1st 2020
Created the Github page and setup all the files.
Added the Bash files, README.MD, Install.MD and so on.
#-----------------------------------------------------
July 2nd 2020
Added some more and updated the instructions;
#-----------------------------------------------------
July 4th 2020
I did another VM install and made some changes to the dependencies
and made a few additions to the instructions and the build process's.
I also did another another install with the New Linux Mint 20 (Not Beta)
in a VM.
Updated all the files a bit...
#-----------------------------------------------------
July 7th 2020
I did several more Linux Mint 20 install in a VM and so far all went well!

I also made some revisions to the text files so that they make more sense
and have more information about the project and build.

I also updated the GitHub README.MD

I also rechecked dependencies and made one change to the dependencies.

I also made a "after-build.sh" script that will finish the install and make
all of the directories, file permissions, and copy the build binary file
where they need to be and copy the defualt spectrwm.conf to the new .config/spectrwm
folder.

I have tested it a ton of times and it works as it should.
With that said, like most thing it works for now! :-)
