### My-Dot .config/spectrwn
This is my Spectrwm /home/bruce/.config/spectrwm files that I use on my
Spectrwm build. These are various small scripts I created for my use.
There not pretty but I never calmed to be a code writer but they work!
This folder started out as Version 3.0.1.2 folder and has
migrated to 3.4.1 now... 07/09/2020
